README â€“ Introduction to AI
This repository contains my work from the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at UPC ETSEIB. Rather than focusing on coding AI algorithms from scratch, the course emphasized understanding how to use existing AI models and distinguishing between them.

The repository is organized into three main folders:

-Clients_Clustering

-Hotel_Cancelations_Predictions

-Predicting_Weather

Project Summaries
1. Hotel_Cancelations_Predictions
This group project (3 students) focuses on predicting whether a hotel booking will be canceled. We selected and preprocessed the dataset ourselves, and the project is structured across three Jupyter notebooks:

data_exploration.ipynb: Initial data exploration, including visualizations, detection/removal of outliers, and filtering irrelevant entries.

data_preparation.ipynb: Implementation of preprocessing steps such as grouping categorical values and applying one-hot encoding.

modeling.ipynb: Application and comparison of several classification algorithms to determine the most effective model.

2. Predicting_Weather
This individual assignment involves time series forecasting for temperature and precipitation. The dataset was provided by the instructor. The objective is to build predictive models for weather-related variables using suitable time series techniques.

3. Clients_Clustering
Also an individual assignment, this task involves applying unsupervised learning techniques to identify customer segments. Using k-NN-based clustering, the goal is to uncover meaningful patterns or groupings among clients.
